# MSScript-DPSChecker
A small tool designed to help with balancing weapons.

### Known Issues:
Certain weapons will not register more than one charge level;
Charge level 2's that use special properties such as throwing the weapon will fail to get any information.

### Future plans:
Quick check for all scripts to see if they can be imported with log file.
Implement ranged weapons.

### Maybe's:
Spells, special projectile types (very unlikely)
